**ðŸ«‚ Hello PEOPLE !!**

Let's see what information we have about this guy.

He goes by the name of Nikhil, though his friends call him Nick. This man can be found in his dorm room goofing around stats to predict a pattern or at times conversing with the graphs.

> Society likes a much professional name, let's call him *Applied ML Developer*. 

Currently he is a sophomore pursuing Bachelor's in Information Science. He comes from a strong background in analytics, with his tech stacks consisting of *Scikit-Learn, Tenserflow, Pandas, Numpy, etc.*

Guy likes to talk about 11 kinds of humor, but seems to possess a 12th kind. He believes that sometimes he may not belong around, but belong to a dystopia far from reality. 

**At times you will find him junking over war and history, otherwise fondling over the aroma of *Chai*.**
